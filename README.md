#### systematic-options-trading: a C++ framework

Build, backtest, and deployment of systematic options trading strategies with a modular C++ framework.  
This is designed for scalability and clarity and separates:

- data handling
- derivative modeling
- strategy logic
- trade execution 

#### Highlights:

* **Organized Architecture:** Easily navigate and extend the codebase with clear module separation (data, models, strategy, utils).
* **Extensible Design:** Implement custom data feeds, pricing models, risk management techniques, and trading signals seamlessly.
* **Test-Driven Development:** Includes a dedicated testing structure to ensure the reliability of your strategies.
* **Cross-Platform Ready:** Leverages CMake for straightforward building on different operating systems.
