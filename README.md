#### systematic-options-trading: a C++ framework

This project is a practice in development to build, backtest, and deploy a systematic options trading strategy in a modular C++ framework.  
This is designed for scalability and clarity and separates:

- Data handling
- Derivatives modeling
- Strategy logic
- Trade execution 

#### Highlights:

* **Organized Architecture:**
  - Easily navigate and extend the codebase with clear module separation (data, models, strategy, utils).
* **Extensible Design:**
  - Implement custom data feeds, pricing models, risk management techniques, and trading signals seamlessly.
* **Test-Driven Development:**
  - Includes a dedicated testing structure to ensure the reliability of the strategy.
* **Cross-Platform Ready:**
  - Leverages CMake for straightforward building on different operating systems.
